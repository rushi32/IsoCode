# IsoCode — VS Code extension

This folder is the VS Code extension (sidebar UI, commands, settings). The main README, install steps, and docs are in the **repo root**: [../README.md](../README.md).

**Quick dev:** From repo root, `npm start`; then here run `npm install` and `npm run compile`, open this folder in VS Code, press F5.
